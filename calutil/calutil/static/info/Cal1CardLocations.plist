		<string>When Chipotle (pronounced chi-POAT-lay) opened its first store in 1993, the idea was simple: demonstrate that food served fast didn&apos;t have to be a &quot;fast-food&quot; experience. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design--features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. When we opened, there wasn&apos;t an industry category to describe what we were doing. Some 16 years and more than 900 restaurants later, we compete in a category of dining now called &quot;fast-casual,&quot; the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry, where customers expect food quality that&apos;s more in line with full-service restaurants, coupled with the speed and convenience of fast food.</string>
